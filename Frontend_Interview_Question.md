### Coding questions

- Make this work:

```
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```

- Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`
- What will be returned by each of these?

```
console.log("hello" || "world");
console.log("foo" && "bar");
```

- Write an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
